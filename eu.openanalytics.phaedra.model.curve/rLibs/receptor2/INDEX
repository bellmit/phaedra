checkED50Range          in cases where estimated ED50 is out of range,
                        checks whether the model fit should be shown or
                        not
compoundStatus          determines whether a compound is inactive or
                        super potent
determineTheSlope       determines the direction of the curve based on
                        various factors
estimateRange           computes the estimated range
extractLogisticModelFit
                        extracts required stuff from a fitted drc model
extractLogisticNoModelFit
                        extracts required stuff when no suitable model
                        could be fitted
fittingLogisticModel    fits a logistic model to the dose-response data
isSaneEDx               checks sanity conditions for an estimated ED50
makingDoseResponseData
                        creates suitable dose-response data out of the
                        provided Excel files
strEndsWith             checks if a strings ends with certain
                        characters
validEDx                returns the valid estimated EDx results
