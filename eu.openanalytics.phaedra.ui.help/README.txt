If you update the Help content, make sure that "eclipsecontexts.xml" DOES NOT CONTAIN any description tags. 

Description tags will interfere with the Context Sensitive Help process. 

If you add a description, the description will be shown instead of the help topic (html file).

Do not copy the following files from the DITAWORKS output in the current project:

- META-INF FOLDER
- plugin.properties
- plugin.xml
- build.properties
