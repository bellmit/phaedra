  <h1 class="topictitle1">Feature Selector</h1>

  <div>
    <p>Just like the Navigator, the <strong>Feature Selector</strong> is an important tool for navigation within Phaedra. It displays the active <em>Feature</em>, along with its active <em>Normalization</em> and active <em>Group</em>. The feature that you select here, is the <em>current feature</em>, and will be applied in many other views, including heatmaps and dose-response curves.</p>

    <p><img src="../../../Images/views/inspectors/feature_inspector/feature_inspector.png" alt="featureInspector.png" /><br /></p>

    <p>Whenever you are looking at well data (e.g. in a plate heatmap), you can choose which well feature to display using the Feature Selector. Switching to another Feature or Normalization will immediately update the view.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of a heatmap showing the feature 'Alamarblue data (RFU)':</p>

    <p><img src="../../../Images/views/inspectors/feature_inspector/heatmapExample0.png" alt="heatmapExample0.png" /><br /></p>

    <p>When you select another feature as the active feature, the Heatmap will instantly update, using that feature's color method:</p>

    <p><img src="../../../Images/views/inspectors/feature_inspector/heatmapExample1.png" alt="heatmapExample1.png" /><br /></p>

    <p>You can change colors used in the heatmap by clicking the color method icon: <img src="../../../Images/views/inspectors/feature_inspector/feature_inspector_colors.png" alt="feature_inspector_colors.png" /><br /></p>

    <p><img src="../../../Images/views/inspectors/feature_inspector/color_method.png" /><br /></p>

    <p>The color method can be plate-based or experiment-based. The latter means that all control wells from the whole experiment are used to calculate the color method's boundary values.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Features and Protocols</h2>
      
      <p>The Features listed in the Feature Selector are the Features that are defined in the currently active <em>Protocol Class</em>. Selecting an object that belongs to another Protocol Class, will change the set of Features listed in the Feature Selector.</p>
