 <div>
  <p>A <strong>well feature</strong> defines an aggregated value per well. For example, consider a well feature named "Cell Count", representing the total number of cells that have been detected in a well.</p>

  <p>Well features are usually provided by the image analysis software. But they may also be calculated in Phaedra, based on subwell features or even other well features. Such a <strong>calculated feature</strong> has a formula associated with it, which will be evaluated by Phaedra and yields a single numeric value per well, just like a regular well feature.</p>

  <p>A typical example of a calculated feature is a ratio between two marker intensity features, one in the cell nucleus, the other in the cell cytoplasm. Such a ratio feature can then be used to study translocation activity.</p>

  <p>Well features are often <strong>normalized</strong> to express their values in a relative way, allowing the values to be compared across plates. Taking again the "Cell Count" feature as an example, this feature could be normalized with the %CTL formula, which will express the value as a percentage relative to the median of the high control wells. If the high controls are assumed to contain a "healthy" amount of cells, the resulting value can be used to identify cell death.</p>

  <p>An important purpose for well features is in <strong>dose-response curve fitting</strong>. When a compound is tested against different concentrations in different wells, the well feature values from those wells can be used to generate a dose-response curve.</p>

  <p>One dose-response curve can be configured per well feature in the protocol class.</p>
