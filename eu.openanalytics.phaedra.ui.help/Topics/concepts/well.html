  <div>
    <p>A <strong>well</strong> is a part of a plate where substances can be added to. Traditional microtiter plates contain 96, 384 or 1536 wells, but Phaedra allows other combinations too.</p>

    <p>For example, when processing a series of microscope slides in Phaedra, the series will be called a plate, and the slides will be called wells. If there are 5 slides, the "plate" will contain 5 "wells".</p>

    <p>Every well has a <strong>well type</strong>, which specifies the role the well plays in the calculation process. A well that contains a compound whose activity is being studied, has the SAMPLE well type. A control well has a well type of LC (Low Control), HC (High Control), or another type of control. A well that does not contain any compound and has no role in the calculation process, has the EMPTY well type.</p>

    <p>Wells that contain a compound may also specify the final <strong>concentration</strong> of that compound in the well. This information is used in dose-response curve fitting.</p>

    <p>Any well may be <strong>rejected</strong> as part of the validation process. A rejected well is usually indicated by having a colored cross drawn over it. Rejected wells do not take part in calculations, and are effectively excluded from further processing.</p>
