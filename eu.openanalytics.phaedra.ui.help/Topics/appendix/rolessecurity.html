    <p>In Phaedra, each protocol is owned by a team. If you are not a member of the owning team, you cannot access the contents of that protocol.</p>

    <p>Within a team, there are four possible membership levels:</p>

    <div class="p">
      <br /><ul>
        <li><strong>Read-only user:</strong> can view all data, but cannot modify anything.</li>

        <li><strong>User:</strong> can create, modify and delete plates. Can create, modify and delete experiments. Can perform plate validation and trigger plate recalculations. If the protocol is in development, the user can also modify the protocol.</li>

        <li><strong>Manager:</strong> As User, plus the permission to perform plate approval. Can modify a protocol, even if it is not in development. Can create, modify and delete protocols.</li>

        <li><strong>Administrator:</strong> Full adminstrative access.</li>

      </ul>

    </div>

    <p>If you try to access a resource or perform an operation you do not have sufficient privileges for, a message dialog will be shown, indicating the required permission level:</p>

    <p><img src="../../Images/appendix/accessDenied.png" alt="accessDenied.png" /><br /></p>

    <p>If you wish to become member of a team, or need additional privileges within your team, please contact a Phaedra administrator.</p>
