  <h1 class="topictitle1">Viewing Plates</h1>

  <div>
    <p>As mentioned in the <a href="navigation.html">Navigation</a> topic, double-clicking on a plate will open a heatmap of that plate. This is the most common type of visualization for a plate in Phaedra. In this topic, several other methods of viewing plates are explained besides the heatmap.</p>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Heatmap</h2>
      
      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/plate2.png" alt="plate2.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>The heatmap is a powerful tool, as it can display a lot of information in one view. By default, a heatmap will show:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <br /><ul>
          <li>The active feature, both as a numeric value and a heatmap color for each well</li>

          <li>The well type of each well</li>

          <li>The rejection status of each well, as a yellow (technical outlier) or red (biological outlier) cross.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

      <p>Heatmaps will sometimes display grey wells, with a NaN feature value, as shown in well H12 in the image above. This means that the feature value for that well is NaN (Not a Number). This may have different causes:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <br /><ul>
          <li>The normalization cannot be calculated, for example because the plate definition has not been linked yet.</li>

          <li>The active feature is a calculated feature which has not been calculated yet, or the calculation formula contains an error.</li>

          <li>The well has no raw feature value, for example because the image analysis failed on that particular well image.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Table</h2>
      
      <p>When opening a plate, the plate view lists two tabs at the bottom: Plate View and Table View. The Plate View contains a heatmap, as explained above. The Table View contains a table listing multiple properties and feature values for each well.</p>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/platetabs.png" alt="platetabs.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>Click on the Table View tab to switch from the heatmap presentation to the table presentation.</p>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/platetableview.png" alt="platetableview.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>The table contains one row for each well. The first column is a thumbnail of the well image. Note that you can make the thumbnail bigger just by resizing the column width.</p>

      <p>Besides several well properties such as well number, well type, compound and concentration, additional columns will display the different well features.</p>

      <p>You can sort these columns by clicking on the column title, or filter rows by typing a value in the field below the column title.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Charts</h2>
      
      <p>Phaedra contains many types of charts, from one-dimensional histograms to three-dimensional scatter plots. Most of these charts can be opened by right-clicking on a plate or well, and selecting the desired chart type in the <strong>Charts</strong> submenu.</p>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/chartsctxmenu.png" alt="chartsctxmenu.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>Charts have many options and settings, and this manual contains a chapter explaining how to configure a chart in great detail. However, the most important setting for any chart is the <strong>axis feature</strong> selection. For example, in a two-dimensional well scatter plot, the X and Y buttons in the top right of the view allow you to specify two well features to plot against each other.</p>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/well2dscatterplot.png" alt="well2dscatterplot.png" /><br /></p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Well Images</h2>
      
      <p>Well images can be shown at any time by right-clicking on a well (in a heatmap or in a table) and selecting Show Well Image.</p>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/showwellimage.png" alt="showwellimage.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>The <strong>Well Image</strong> view will open, showing the well image.</p>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/wellimageview.png" alt="wellimageview.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>Just like the Chart views, this view has many settings, which are explained in a dedicated topic in this manual. Listed below are the most important functions:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <br /><ul>
          <li>You can zoom in and out using the scroll wheel on your mouse.</li>

          <li>You can pan the image by clicking and holding the left mouse button, and dragging the cursor around.</li>

          <li>By default, all image channels are displayed, on top of each other. You can toggle channels on and off using the numbered channel buttons directly above the image.</li>

        </ul>

      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="sectiontitle">Dose-response Curves</h2>
      
      <p>If the protocol has been configured to calculate dose-response curves, you can view those curves in two ways:</p>

      <div class="p">
        <br /><ol>
          <li>Right-click on a plate and select <strong>Browse Dose-response Curves</strong></li>

          <li>Right-click on a well and select <strong>Show Dose-response Curve</strong></li>

        </ol>

      </div>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/browsecurves.png" alt="browsecurves.png" /><br /><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/showcurve.png" alt="showcurve.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>When using the first method, a new view will open listing all the compounds in the selected plate, along with the dose-response curves for all features that have a curve configured for them.</p>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/compoundbrowser.png" alt="compoundbrowser.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>When using the second method, a smaller view will open to the right of the screen, showing a single dose-response curve in greater detail.</p>

      <p><img src="../../Images/gettingstarted/crcdetails.png" alt="crcdetails.png" /><br /></p>

      <p>In the image above, the blue curve represents the fitted dose-response curve. The dotted black line indicates the pIC50 value, while the dotted red and green lines represent the lower and upper bounds respectively. The blue circles are the well samples that were used for fitting the curve.</p>
